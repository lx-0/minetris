// Story Fragments — lore collectibles with per-run drop logic.
//
// Each expedition run has a chance to surface one story fragment per run.
// Fragments are tied to biomes, have a rarity, and never re-drop once collected.
// Legendary fragments only unlock after the player has collected 50%+ of that
// biome's common fragments.
//
// Load order: after expedition-session.js, before main.js.

    lore: 'Quartz formations the size of houses grew in a sealed pocket for ten thousand years. When the miners broke through, the air was so cold it burned. The crystals hummed at a frequency that made tools vibrate loose from handles. The chamber was resealed within a week. The maps mark it only as "Restricted."',

    lore: 'The great crack runs north to south for three hundred meters before it vanishes under compacted rubble. On one side: limestone. On the other: basalt. They should not be adjacent — they formed in different eras, under different pressures. Whatever event brought them together also erased everything between them.',

The oldest miners called it the Ur-Stone — the substance from which all other stone learned to be stone. It has no seams. It has always been exactly what it is.',

The forest has no center. Every tree is the center. The network has been running longer than the oldest tree has been standing.',

If you breathe it in — and you cannot avoid it — you carry the forest\'s intentions with you for weeks. It is not harmful. But you will dream of trees.',

The rings in the heartwood no longer show annual growth — the tree aged past years into something else. Cut a cross-section and the pattern inside is not concentric circles. It is a map of a place that does not correspond to anywhere on the surface.',

The response is too coordinated to be coincidence and too slow to be electrical. Whatever intelligence the forest holds is distributed, patient, and very old. It has been making decisions since before the word "decision" existed.',

The root network beneath it connects to every other tree in the forest — the network flows through it, not around it. When the wind moves it, the entire forest shudders. When it shudders, the root network carries something that is not a nutrient and not a signal. The other trees go quiet for days afterward.',

    lore: 'Long before the first settlement, the forest made an agreement with the stone beneath it. The roots do not break the deep rock; the rock does not close the water channels the roots need. For ten thousand years this treaty has held. The forest knows that if it ever violates the accord, the stone will remember. So far, the forest has chosen continuity over conquest. So far.',

Something lives in the thermal gradient between the chambers. It has adapted so completely to ice and cold and pressure that warmth itself is lethal to it.
